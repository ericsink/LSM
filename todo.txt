still lots of automerge issues

opencursor issues, info for optimistic merge

more test cases

page level encryption

need to actually design the file header
checksums for data integrity

do we need IDatabase if there is only one implementation
of it?  same for IWriteLock.

--

bloom filters?

try to improve the performance of multicursor

lz4

tool to find closures, or nested functions that could be
moved outside

experiment with inline for certain functions

consider nessos streams instead of seq<kvp> ?

need something to make sure that only one Database object
exists for a given file

do we have a test that chains multicursors with other multicursors?

#if integrity_checks

look at reducing memory allocations in writeLeaves

write a test that verifies that BTreeSegment.Create
never seeks if it has no boundary.  (but overflows break
this now).  need a stream
that overrides seek and throws.  this test preserves
the ability to write a btree into almost any kind of
stream.  common use case remains writing with an
involved page manager.

--------

test multicursor with the same cursor twice?

test multicursor with two identical subs?

--------

still concerned about how much we are copying byte[] for keys

what are the embedded pointers in the runs in SQLite4 LSM?

tombstones shouldn't need a length field as well.
but the absence would mess up the space_needed calcs.
and if the length is always zero, it's just a byte.

--------

now we can chain a
zlib stream and compress as it goes in.

create shorter synthetic keys in the parent nodes?
